# Blast101_code
This archive contains the main code for the Bioinformatics Algorithms BLAST class that implements BLAST-like and Smith Waterman search in Python.

This is code is designed for teaching and uses a limited subset of Python- that which we teach in introductory Python courses.  

The class ICA extends this code to add tests so that the validity of the code can be checked.  This is 'beta code' designed for teaching, not for use outside the classroom.
